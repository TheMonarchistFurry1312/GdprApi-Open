API endpoints (overview)
The API exposes REST endpoints and a Swagger UI.

Authentication
- /auth/token (POST) -> exchange credentials for a JWT
- Use Authorization: Bearer <token>

Subjects
- POST /subjects -> create a subject
- GET /subjects/{id} -> get subject
- GET /subjects?email= -> search by identifier

DSR (Data Subject Request)
- POST /dsr -> create a new DSR
- GET /dsr/{id} -> fetch DSR details
- PATCH /dsr/{id}/assign -> assign to an operator
- PATCH /dsr/{id}/status -> update status
- GET /dsr?status=pending -> list by status

Consent
- POST /consents -> create consent record
- GET /consents/{id} -> get consent entry
- POST /consents/{id}/revoke -> revoke consent
- GET /consents?subjectId= -> list consents for a subject

Audit
- GET /audits?entityId=&entityType= -> query audit trail
- POST /audits/search -> advanced search

Admin
- POST /admin/retention/run -> force retention job
- GET /admin/health -> health checks
- GET /admin/metrics -> metrics endpoint

Examples (curl)
Create a subject
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/subjects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "identifiers": [{"type":"email","value":"alice@example.com"}] }'

Create a DSR
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/dsr \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "subjectId":"<subjectId>", "type":"access", "metadata": {"requester":"alice@example.com"} }'

Revoke consent
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/consents/<consentId>/revoke \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

Export a DSR package (server-side)
- When a DSR reaches the export step, the API creates a ZIP and stores it in the exports bucket.
- GET /dsr/{id}/export returns a pre-signed URL.

Consent and DSR workflows
Intake
- The API accepts requests from UI, email pipelines, or third-party forms.
- The system validates subject identity via matching identifiers.
- Intake creates a DSR record and starts the lifecycle.

Verification
- The system supports verification strategies:
  - email challenge
  - two-factor code
  - manual verification by an operator
- Verification events log to audits.

Processing
- Operators see an ordered queue.
- Background tasks run enrichment jobs.
- The API can call connectors to external systems to fetch personal data.

Resolution
- For access requests, the API bundles subject data and provides a URL for download.
- For erasure, the API marks records and runs retention purge flows.
- For portability, the API packages data in machine-readable format (JSON/CSV).

Consent model
- Store consent as an event stream.
- Do not mutate old consent entries. Append new entries for changes.
- Each consent record contains:
  - purpose or scope
  - version
  - timestamp
  - source
  - user agent and IP (when available)
- Use consent versioning to track policy changes.

Audit logs and retention
- All state transitions produce an audit entry.
- Audit entries contain a snapshot of the entity and the actor context.
- Make audits append-only in storage.
- Retention job prunes non-essential fields after retention windows expire.
- Keep a retention policy table for tenants.

Security and compliance guidance
Authentication and authorization
- Use JWT with rotating signing keys for service-to-service calls.
- Validate audience, issuer, and expiry.
- Use role claims to gate actions:
  - role: operator
  - role: admin
  - role: auditor

Encryption
- Enforce TLS in transit.
- Encrypt at rest if supported by the hosting platform or MongoDB Atlas.
- Do not store secrets in code. Use secret stores or environment variables.

Logging
- Log structured entries.
- Redact personal data from logs.
- Store logs outside the primary data store.

Access controls
- Implement least privilege on service accounts.
- Use tenant isolation in queries.

Processing sensitive data
- Minimize data copies.
- Hash identifiers when possible.
- Implement a purge flow tied to the retention policy.

Third-party sharing
- Record consent for each external share.
- Track purpose and recipient in consent metadata.

Testing and CI
Unit tests
- Use xUnit for unit tests.
- Mock MongoDB with test collections or use in-memory wrappers.

Integration tests
- Use Docker Compose to spin up a test MongoDB.
- Run integration tests in CI with a clean DB per run.

CI pipelines
- Build and test on each pull request.
- Run static analyzers and code formatters.
- Build release artifacts on merge to main.

FAQ
How do I test DSR flows?
- Use the provided sample data and Postman collection.
- Create a subject and submit a DSR.
- Use the UI or API to process the DSR through its lifecycle.

Can I use a managed MongoDB?
- Yes. The app supports MongoDB Atlas or other hosted solutions.

How do I handle long-running exports?
- The API spawns a background job that generates the package.
- Use webhook notifications to inform the caller when the export is ready.

How do I handle verification requests?
- Configure an email provider.
- Use the verification endpoints to send challenge tokens.

Troubleshooting
- Check logs at startup to see missing config keys.
- Ensure MongoDB is reachable from the host.
- Verify JWT secret length and algorithm.

Advanced topics
Multi-tenant isolation
- Use tenantId in every query.
- Enforce tenant-aware indexes.
- Support tenant-scoped configuration.

Policy engine hooks
- Expose event hooks for custom rules.
- Let operators approve or deny requests via the API.

Export formats and packaging
